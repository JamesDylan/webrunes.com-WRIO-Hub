These stories will be followed by previews of projects mentioned throughout the narrative. Keep in mind: some of these ideas may change, some may not, and others will remain a fantasy. At the moment we are a small team, but we harbor a great desire to change this world for the better or at least a little bit.",

It consists of data structure blocks—which hold exclusively data in initial blockchain implementations, and both data and programs in some (for example, Ethereum) of the more recent implementations—with each block holding batches of individual transactions and the results of any blockchain executables. Each block contains a timestamp and information linking it to a previous block.",
